# MonteCarloInputs

Create Inputs for a Monte Carlo Simulation.

# Background

This package simplifies creating rudimentary Monte Carlo simulation inputs. Monte Carlo analysis was an early computational analysis which was used in the Manhattan project during World War II. At the time major operations had code names, so the code name for the Monte Carlo analysis came from the Monte Carlo Casino. Randoms inputs are generated to see how random variation in the inputs of a system propagate to the outputs.

This package is intended for quickly generating inputs for a simple analysis or simulation. It only supports normal or uniform distributions.
